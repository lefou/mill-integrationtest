Integration testing for mill plugins.

== Quickstart

We assume, you have a mill plugin named `mill-demo`

[source,scala]
----
// build.sc
import mill._, mill.scalalib._
object demo extends ScalaModule with PublishModule {
  // ...
}
----

Add an new test sub-project, e.g. `itest`.

[source,scala,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import $ivy.`de.tototec::de.tobiasroeser.mill.integrationtest:{version}`
import de.tobiasroeser.mill.integrationtest._

object itest extends MillIntegrationTestModule {

  def millTestVersion = "{exampleMillVersion}"

  def pluginsUnderTest = Seq(demo)

}
----

Your project should now look similar to this:

----
.
+-- demo/
|   +-- src/
|
+-- itest/
    +-- src/
        +-- 01-first-test/
        |   +-- build.sc
        |   +-- src/
        |
        +-- 02-second-test/
            +-- build.sc
----

As the buildfiles `build.sc` in your test cases typically want to access the locally built plugin(s),
the plugins publishes all modules referenced under `pluginsUnderTest` and `temporaryIvyModule` to a temporary ivy repository,
just before the test is executed.
The mill version used in the integration test then uses that temporary ivy repository.

Instead of referring to your plugin with `import $ivy.'your::plugin:version'`,
you can use the following line instead, which ensures you will use the correct locally build plugins.

[source,scala]
----
// build.sc
import $exec.plugins
----

Effectively, at execution time, this line gets replaced by the content of `plugins.sc`,
a file which was generated just before the test started to execute.
It will `$ivy` import all dependencies you listed in `pluginsUnderTest`.

.Example for a generated `plugins.sc`
[source,scala]
----
// Import a locally published version of the plugin under test
import $ivy.`org.example:mill-demo_2.12:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`
----

== Configuration and Targets

The `MillIntegrationTestModule` trait provides the following targets:

.Mandatory configuration
* `def millTestVersion: T[String]`
  The mill version used for executing the test cases.
  Used by `downloadMillTestVersion` to automatically download.

* `def pluginsUnderTest: Seq[PublishModule]` -
  The plugins used in the integration test.
  You should at least add your plugin under test here.
  You can also add additional libraries, e.g. those that assist you in the test result validation (e.g. a local test support project).
  The defined modules will be published into a temporary ivy repository before the tests are executed.
  In your test `build.sc` file, instead of the typical `import $ivy.` line,
  you should use `import $exec.plugins` to include all plugins that are defined here.

.Optional configuration
* `def temporaryIvyModules: Seq[PublishModule]` -
  Additional modules you need in the temporary ivy repository, but not in the resulting mill build classpath.
  The defined modules will be published into a temporary ivy repository before the tests are executed.
  This is almost the same as `pluginsUnderTest`, but does not end up in the generated `plugins.sc`.

* `def sources: Sources` -
  Locations where integration tests are located.
  Each integration test is a sub-directory, containing a complete test mill project.

* `def testCases: Target[Seq[PathRef]]` -
  The directories each representing a mill test case.
  Derived from `sources`.

* `def testInvocations: Target[Seq[(PathRef, Seq[TestInvocation.Targets])]]` -
  The test invocations to test the project.
  Defaults to run `TestInvokation.Targets` with the targets from [[testTargets]] and expecting successful execution.
  For each test case, you can define a seq of invocations.

* `def testTargets: Target[Seq[String]]` -
  _Deprecated: Please use `testInvocations` instead_
  The targets which are called to test the project.
  Defaults to `verify`, which should implement test result validation.

* `def downloadMillTestVersion: T[PathRef]` -
  Download the mill version as defined by `millTestVersion`.
  Override this, if you need to use a custom built mill version.
  Returns the `PathRef` to the mill executable (must have the executable flag).

* `def useCachedMillDownload: T[Boolean]` -
  If `true`, the downloaded mill version used for tests will be cached to the system cache dir (e.g. `~/.cache`).

.Commands / Action Targets
* `def test(): Command[Seq[TestCase]]` -
  Run the integration tests.

* `def testCached: Target[Seq[TestCase]]` -
  Run the integration tests (same as `test`), but only if any input has changed since the last run.

== How can I ...

=== Run multiple targets in one go

Use `testInvocations` to configure the targets to execute.
[source,scala]
----
def testInvocations = T{
  Seq(
    pathRefToTest1 -> Seq(
      TestInvocation.Targets(Seq("target1", "target2"))
    )
  )
}
----

=== Run multiple mill invocations with different or even the same targets

Use `testInvocations` to configure the targets to execute.
[source,scala]
----
def testInvocations = T{
  Seq(
    pathRefToTest1 -> Seq(
      // first mill run
      TestInvocation.Targets(Seq("target1", "target2")),
      // second mill run
      TestInvocation.Targets(Seq("target3", "target4")),
      // third mill run with same targets
      TestInvocation.Targets(Seq("target3", "target4"))
    )
  )
}
----

=== Test failing mill targets

Use `testInvocations` to configure the targets to execute and fail.
[source,scala]
----
def testInvocations = T{
  Seq(
    pathRefToTest1 -> Seq(
      // first 2 targets that should succeed
      TestInvocation.Targets(Seq("target1", "target2")),
      // third target should fail with exit code 1
      TestInvocation.Targets(Seq("target3"), expectedExitCode = 1)
    )
  )
}
----

=== Better prints context of failed targets

Use `munit`'s Assertions when defining your test targets
[source,scala]
----
// itest/src/project1/build.sc
import $ivy.`org.scalameta::munit:0.7.7`, munit.Assertions._
def verify() = T.command {
  assert(None.isDefined)
  val fixedScala = read(os.pwd / "foo" / "src" / "Fix.scala")
  val expected   = """object Fix {
                   |  def procedure(): Unit = {} xxx
                   |}
                   |""".stripMargin
  assertEquals(fixedScala, expected)
}
----

=== Properly test a mill plugin that uses a worker implementation

You probably want to load the worker in a separated classloader,
hence it should not end up in mills classpath.
Define the plugin module with `pluginsUnderTest` and the worker module with `temporaryIvyModules`.
This will ensure that all modules will be build and published to the test ivy repository,
but only those listed in `pluginsUnderTest` will end up in the generated `plugins.sc`.

[source,scala]
----
def itest extends MillIntegrationTestModule {
  def pluginsUnderTest = Seq(plugin)
  def temporaryIvyModules = Seq(api, worker)
  // ...
}
----

=== Test with multiple mill versions, e.g. on a CI server

Mill hasn't a stable API (yet) and there are no binary compatibility guarantees.
So, it is a good idea to add all supported mill version to your CI setup.

As a best practice, you can use the value of a `TEST_MILL_VERSION` system environment variable, if defined.

[source,scala]
----
object itest extends MillIntegrationTestModule {
  def millTestVersion = T {
    T.ctx().env.get("TEST_MILL_VERSION").filterNot(_.isEmpty).getOrElse(defaultMillVersion)
  }
  ..
}
----

To test with mill 0.6.0, run `TEST_MILL_VERSION=0.6.0 mill itest.test`.

If you use Travis-CI, a `.travis.yml` might look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
env:
  - TEST_MILL_VERSION=0.6.0
  - TEST_MILL_VERSION=0.6.1

script:
  - mill -i itest.test

== Version Compatibility Matrix

Mill is still in active development, and has no stable API yet.
Hence, not all mill-integrationtest versions work with every mill version.

The following table shows a matrix of compatible mill and mill-integrationtest versions.

.Version Compatibility Matrix
